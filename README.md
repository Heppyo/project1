# Direkte oversatt prompt fra ChatGPT:
#Below is an excerpt from a job listing. Evaluate whether the listing uses "flowery language" to describe the job, the work #tasks, the firm, and the benefits associated with the job. Use the 5-point additive scoring system described below.

#Points are accumulated based on the satisfaction of each criterion:

 #   Add 1 point if the job listing uses mild, positive language that is somewhat flattering but generally realistic. It may promote the company or role but without exaggeration or superlative language.
 #   Add another point if the job listing begins to use vague or generic language to describe tasks or the work environment, without concrete details (e.g., "you will make a real impact" without specifying how).
 #   Award a third point if the job listing overstates the responsibilities, culture, or benefits in a way that feels excessive or disingenuous (e.g., claiming the company has a "world-class" culture or offers "unparalleled growth opportunities" without specifics).
  #  Grant a fourth point if the listing heavily emphasizes prestige or idealizes the job or company with exaggerated descriptions of the work (e.g., "you'll be part of a groundbreaking team changing the world every day").
   # Bestow a fifth point if the listing is excessively flattering or embellished in almost every aspect, with little focus on practical job duties and instead presenting an overly idealized version of the role, the firm, and the benefits, including highly aspirational claims.

#The excerpt: <excerpt>.

#After examining the excerpt:

 #   Briefly justify your total score, up to 100 words.
#    Conclude with the score using the format: "Flowery language score: <total points>"
